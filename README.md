# 🚑 VR First Aid Training Prototype – Master’s Thesis

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the VR prototype developed for my Master’s Thesis in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Siegen.  
The project explores the potential of **Virtual Reality (VR)** as a training tool for public first-aid education.  

Using **Unity 6.1 (URP)** and deployed on **Meta Quest 3**, the prototype simulates an urban road accident scenario where players act as first responders.  
Core interactions include securing the accident scene, calling emergency services, and assessing the victim.

## 📖 Methodology
### 1. Research Framework
- Applied **User-Centered Design (UCD)**.  
- Phases: Survey → Prototyping → Usability Testing → Iteration.  

### 2. Development Phases
| Phase | Task |
|-------|------|
| 1 | Scene setup (urban accident, vehicles, ambient audio) |
| 2 | Player navigation + XR interactions |
| 3 | Emergency checklist + UI system |
| 4 | Feedback system (success/failure) |
| 5 | Usability testing + refinement |

### 3. Evaluation
- Preliminary survey: low first-aid confidence, high interest in VR learning.  
- Usability testing (n=2): engaging & immersive, but UI/interaction alignment issues.  
- Data collected: SUS scores, task completion, qualitative feedback.  

---

## 📊 Results
- **Survey**: Limited real-life first-aid confidence, strong belief in VR as effective learning.  
- **Prototype**: Demonstrated feasibility of VR for gamified first-aid training.  
- **Usability**: Participants rated VR engaging, but noted interaction and motion sickness challenges.  
- **Research Questions**:  
  - *RQ1*: Unity achieved functional realism for first-aid scenarios.  
  - *RQ2*: Usability issues emerged with hand/controller interactions and UI alignment.  
  - *RQ3*: Participants reported VR as more motivating than traditional training.
